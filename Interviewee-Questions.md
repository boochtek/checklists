These are questions that are good to ask as an *interviewee*, a candidate for a developer job.

General
-------

* What's the best part of the job?
* What's the worst part of the job? Or, what would you most like to change?
* What does a typical day look like?
* What does success look like?
* What's the recent turn-over look like? Why are people leaving? Where are they going?
* How has the company changed/evolved in the past few years?
* What's the next step in the interview/hiring process?

Processes
---------

* How many meetings do you have in an average week? How long are they? What's the content?
* What does your deployment process look like? How long does it take? Who does it? How often?
* How long are your iterations?
* How long are your standups?
* How much test coverage do you have? Do you have end-to-end tests as well?
* What branching strategy do you use?
* What's your code review process?
* How do you track stories, tasks, bugs?

Collaboration
-------------

* Do teams go out to lunch together?
* How much pairing does the team do?
* How do developers and QA testers work together?
* How do developers and designers work together?
* How do developers and product owners work together?
* How much access to actual customers/users do we get?
* How does work get from the customer to the developers? Is there a feedback loop?
* How big is your backlog? What state is it in? How often is it groomed?
* How are developers protected from distractions?

Benefits
--------

* How much conference attendance will you pay for? What if I'm speaking?
* How much vacation time? How is it earned? If unlimited, what's average/typical?
* What are the policies on working from home?


Are they "Fake Agile"
---------------------

1. Can you tell me about all the meetings you have in an average week?
2. What does your deployment process look like, how long does it take, who does it, and how often?
3. What processes do you have that could use significant improvement?


What You Need To Convey
-----------------------

As recommended by my buddy Jim Leingang, an interviewee needs only convince the interviewer(s) of 3 things:

* I can do the job
* I want the job
* I can be trusted

One other piece of advice he gave (for a phone interview):

* Smile
